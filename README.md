============

Some Haskell-inspired functionality for Java. Including all of Data.List implemented with Iterables!

Status
----------

So far, only the Pair, Triple, Quadruple, Quintuple, and Sextuple classes are fully documented and tested. Everything
else is a work in progress. However, if a particular method has JavaDoc and a corresponding test method, it is safe to
use.
